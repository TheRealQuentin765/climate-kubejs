# climate-kubejs
Adds compasses to the corner of the screen that show climate info (when holding a supplementaries wind vane) to help find biomes in a less cheaty way then using a seed map.

Tested on 1.18 forge
Probably Works on 1.16 forge & 1.16 fabric & 1.18 fabric
Does not work on 1.19

***Requires Supplementaries*** (because of the item that makes the stuff appear)
However, you can easily change the item and then it would work in vanillia.
That said, why would you not want to have supplementaries installed? Its a great mod.
